# workshop_2_example

Here is a URL to the webpage for this project: https://elam-fine-arts-205.github.io/workshop_2_example/

(Remember to include a link to the webpage in your README file)

Use the README file to document your work on the task. Mention the different coding concepts/functions/shapes you've used, and how you've applied these to draw things to the screen and to organise your sketch.

Keep a clear record of what you've learnt in your own words, so you can return to it later if you need to. You don't need to write an essay, just some notes that could be **useful to you**. By the way, to make text bold in a README file, put two asterisks (*) before and after the text you want to be bold. You can find [more tips here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), including how to do inline links.

Create a separate repository for each task.
