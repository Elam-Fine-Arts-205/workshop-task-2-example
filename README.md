# workshop-task-2-example

Here is a URL to the webpage for this project: [https://elam-fine-arts-205.github.io/workshop-task-2-example/](https://elam-fine-arts-205.github.io/workshop-task-2-example/)

(Remember to include a link to the webpage in your README file)

Use the README file to document your work on the task. Mention the different coding concepts/functions/shapes you've used, and how you've applied these to draw things to the screen and to organise your sketch. See the assingment brief on Canvas for further guidance on how to document your work in a README file.

You don't need to write an essay, but make sure to include notes that could be **useful to you**. By the way, to make text bold in a README file, put two asterisks (*) before and after the text you want to be bold. You can find [more tips here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), including how to do inline links.

Create a separate repository for each workshop task.

## This is a level 2 heading

You might organise your READEME file under different headings.

- you could also use bullet points
- like these
- just use the hyphen (-) symbol to create them

### Level 3 heading

More text would go here under this heading.

## Adding code extracts (quoting code)

Adding code extracts (quoting code) is very useful. See the [guidance on how to this](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#quoting-code). The extracts will be formatted like this: 

```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
}
```
Note that you can copy the code in the extract above using the button in the top-right corner.

## Adding images

You can add an image by copying the image file (Ctrl+C) on your computer and pasting it (Ctrl+V) into the README file as you're editing it.

When you've pasted the image, it should look something like this (the image will show once you've finished editing the README file):

![images-example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c01cd560-8cdd-4466-900e-ae51ac50a1cd)

Here's an image of some apples:

![apples](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e92bdc3-0957-476a-a303-ee0156a866f8)

Alternatively, you can add images by creating a folder in your repository and linking to them in the README file.
